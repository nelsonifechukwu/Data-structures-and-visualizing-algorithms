// components: are pieces o code created by a programmer, which could be reused
// by another

/*
E.g of components:
- algorithms
- codeblock
- patterns: is a template for a particular programming technique
- abstract data types: define the effects of ops, but not the implementation of
these ops.
- libraries
*/

/*
Learning about components:
- exploratory learning: explicity allot time to learn new components
- as-needed learning: learn as you go, as the problem requires

See: strategy -> varying implementations, same result
 vs policy -> varying implementations affect outcome
